Hey!

Thanks for purchasing this package, I hope it helps you with you project.

First off: I wrote this code ages ago in a different life, and as such am not comfortable making
any claims about code quality. If I'd write it today, it'd look different.

Anyways...

What will be of most interest to you is the Player prefab, with its Wing and Controller scripts. They
handle player input, aerodynamics, and stability. Another script you might like is the CameraController
which handles the 3rd person camera motion.

These scripts have been cleaned up and documented since their original game-jam conception, but if
anything is still unclear don't hesitate to ask me any questions.

The rest of the code in the project is probably not very interesting. It's not of the highest quality,
and you probably have your own logic for major game flow anyway.

You can contact me though:
