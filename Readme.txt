Hey!

Thanks for checking out this package, I hope it helps you with your project.

First off: I wrote this code ages ago in a different life, and as such am not comfortable making
any claims about code quality. If I'd write it today, it'd look different.

Anyways...

What will be of most interest to you is the Player prefab, with its Wing and Controller scripts. They
handle player input, aerodynamics, and stability. Another script you might like is the CameraController,
which handles the 3rd person camera motion.

These scripts have been cleaned up and documented since their original game-jam conception, but if
anything is still unclear don't hesitate to ask me any questions.

You can contact me though:

Good luck!
